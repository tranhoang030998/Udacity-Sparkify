# Sparkify Project
A digital music service like Spotify and Youtube Music is called Sparkify. Users can subscribe, listen to their favorite music for free (with advertisements) or with pay, add friends or songs to their playlists,…

In this project, we will manipulate large and realistic datasets with Spark to engineer relevant features for predicting churn. We will use Spark MLlib to build machine learning models with large datasets.

## Instructions
The code is saved in ```.ipynb``` file and can be run with any tool that support this file format. These are libraries that is used in this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- warnings

## Results
For the code, please check the notebook ```Sparkify.ipynb```.
